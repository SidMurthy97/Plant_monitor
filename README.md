## Plant monitor

A project build to monitor my plant remotely. It is a data collection tool which records the soil moisture along with the ambient humidty and temperature 
and pushes it to a FLask server. Here, it is plotted using chartjs. See build process here https://www.hackster.io/murthysiddhant/plant-monitor-sensor-to-front-end-c1f715
